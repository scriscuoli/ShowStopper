# ShowStopper
## An application for timestamp tracking events during a recorded event

ShowStopper was originally developed to track topic changes during a podcast I 
am part of. The application has a nice flexibility to track anything that is
timed. I have used it to track the various speakers during a debate.

The kinds of things you can track are defined and can be given a color scheme.
For example, we track when someone swears (our podcast is family-friendly and the
editor has to replace those with sound effects) and that shows up in red and white
in the list. The things you are tracking are listed in the entries form and each
is assigned a button. In this way, during the live performance, all you have to do
is push buttons. I've included a screenshow example.

NOTE: When defining "colors" of things to track, if you add an asterisk to the end
of the name (for example, you will see that it is TOPIC* not TOPIC when you open
that dialog when you push the colors button) then you are defining that type of
entry as one whose time duration is of interest. When you save your results, you
will see that all the time for a given type is added up in the summary. As an example,
when I was using this app for the debate, I defined a color for entries of type
SPEAKER and then a entry (or type SPEAKER) for each speaker. As I pushed the buttons
for each speaker as they went back and forth (there were six speakers) the summary
gave me a total time each speaker spoke.
